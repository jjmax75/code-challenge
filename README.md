# Sportdec front-end code challenge

## Assumptions
- The final score from the shootout is 4 - 5 (Oldham winning) but the shootout array data point in team_data for the home team shows the 6th penalty as "Scored", this should be "Saved". The events array data point backs this up as Liam Feeney's penalty has value "Saved". I am changing the JSON in team_data to reflect this.

## Oustanding issues
- Styling - need to style all parts of app, currently barebones
- Testing - need to cover all components and functions with tests, both e2e and unit

## Future dev
- Natural language generation of match report
- Speech synthesis API to speak report with background music - Lightning Seeds Life of Riley
