# Sportdec front-end code challenge

## Assumptions
- The final score from the shootout is 4 - 5 (Oldham winning) but the shootout array data point in team_data for the home team shows the 6th penalty as "Scored", this should be "Saved". The events array data point backs this up as Liam Feeney's penalty has value "Saved". I am changing the JSON in team_data to reflect this.
